### Key Features:

- Relying solely on HTML and CSS.
- The page is designed with a simple and "childish" fell in mind as it is designed for the youngest up to adolescent age.

This project reflects my commitment to delivering an enjoyable and visually appealing instamatic journey, showcasing my evolution within the realm of HTML andCSS.
